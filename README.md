# Sales_Analysis_Python
I used Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

I started by cleaning data. Tasks during this section includes:

Drop NaN values from DataFrame
Removing rows based on a condition
Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

4 high level business questions related to our data:

What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
What city sold the most product?
What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
What products are most often sold together?
To answer these questions I walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:

Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
Adding columns
Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
Using the .apply() method
Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize results
Labeling graphs
